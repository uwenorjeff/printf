PROJECT TITLE:
Creating A Printf(Print Formatted) Project

PROJECT Description:
"printf" is the name of one of the main C output functions, and stands for "print formatted". The printf() is a library function to send formatted output to the screen. The function prints the string inside quotations.printf is a special function because it receives a variable number of arguments. The first parameter is fixed and is the format string. It includes text to be printed literaly and marks to be replaced by the text obtained from the additional parameters. Thus, printf is invoked with as many parameters as marks are included in the format string, plus one (the format string itself). The following example shows how to print the value of variable school.

printf("The value is %d\n", school);

The symbol “%” denotes the beginning of a format mark. The mark “%d” is replaced by the value of variable school and the resulting string is printed. The symbol “\n” represents a new line. By default, all output is right-justified, that is, is placed on the right edge of the field and, by default, the width of the field is the same width as the string length.
